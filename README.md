# BoltsAndNuts
Code Sample: In Plant 3D create physical bolts. Use at own risk!

<pre>
limitations:
this was made for metric projects, for sure it needs to be modified for imperial and mixed metric projects
for now only working with FL, WF or LUG connections
only looking at S1 and S2 ports (not e.g. S3)
currently the boltcircleradius is considered to belong to the bolt geometry data, but in reality it is a flange parameter, so this might need to change
many more limitations expected due to so many special cases can exist regarding e.g. connection situation or boltset requirements
